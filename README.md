UOW CSIT214 Group project

- We have used html, css, bootstrap and javascript

- For storage purposes, we have used javascript localStorage, however in the future, a database should be implemented for best results

- We used Bootstrap , an open-source CSS framework, to make the website responsive and to accelerate visual design using its pre-built classes and components (like navbar, card, carousel, accordion, modal).
    
- Our code follows bootstrap 5.0 documentation with our own customization: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/
